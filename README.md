# DOMinationJS-Samples
These are common implementation examples provided to help people use this awesome minimalistic library.

## Included are three implementation:
- **Inline JS** - Single HTML page with an inline script tag.
- **TypeScript** - A TypeScript project with UMD webpack build process. (The only one with route example for now)
- **Vanilla JS** - An external JavaScipt file being referenced by a script tag.

## Getting Started
1. ```npm run init``` in package.json
2. ```npm run init``` in typescript/package.json
3. ```npm run build``` in typescript/package.json
4. ```npm run start``` in package.json

Once all these npm script are run it will open a new browser tab on localhost 3000. Feel free to play around, also included is a ```npm run watch``` command so the typescript will auto-build when changes are saved. So you can experiment and get quick feedback.


## More to come..
- Covering more advanced performance focused implementations for enterprise level applications.
